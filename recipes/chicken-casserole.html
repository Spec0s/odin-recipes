        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I made this casserole recipe up and my kids love it! Chicken melds with lots of flavors like bacon, ranch, and Colby Jack to make a yummy feast for the whole family.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package wide egg noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound bacon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot skillet, sprinkle with lemon-pepper, and brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        </ol>
